<h3>AI for Medical Image Processing</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have proposed a novel score-matching formula to derive a new score function through deep learning on an image dataset. By integrating our new score function into the image reconstruction process, we have developed a new iterative reconstruction method within the MAP estimation framework to enhance image quality. We have evaluated the performance of our image reconstruction method on both public medical CT datasets and clinical raw datasets. Our reconstruction method consistently produced higher quality images in terms of PSNR and SSIM metrics across diverse datasets. Notably, on Siemens and GE clinical CT raw datasets, our proposed approach achieved superior denoising and deblurring effects over the competing methods, illustrating remarkable generalizability and stability. Our proposed score matching formula holds potential in image denoising, deblurring, and generation.</p>

<h3>AI for Monochromatic Medical Imaging</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Conventional single-spectrum computed tomography (CT) reconstructs spectrally integrated attenuation images, offering detailed tissue morphology but lacking insights into the elemental composition of tissues. In contrast, dual-energy CT (DECT) acquires two spectrally distinct datasets, enabling the reconstruction of energy-selective virtual monoenergetic (VM) images and material-selective (material decomposition) images. However, DECT increases system complexity and exposes patients to higher radiation doses compared to single-spectrum CT. This invention proposes a deep learning-based method to generate VM images directly from single-spectrum CT images. An improved residual neural network (IResNet) model has been developed to map single-spectrum CT images to VM images at pre-specified energy levels. Trained on clinical DECT data, the network demonstrates excellent convergence and produces highly accurate VM images, achieving a relative error of less than 2% compared to DECT-derived VM images. Additionally, the method facilitates multi-material decomposition into three distinct tissue classes with accuracy comparable to DECT, offering a promising alternative with reduced system complexity and lower radiation exposure.</p>

<h3>Future Directions in AI for Medical Imaging</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into medical imaging is progressing rapidly, paving the way for transformative advancements in healthcare. In the coming years, AI is expected to revolutionize diagnostic accuracy, treatment planning, and clinical workflows. By identifying subtle patterns in medical images that might be overlooked by the human eye, AI will enhance diagnostic precision. Future AI models will improve in sensitivity and specificity, enabling earlier detection of conditions such as cancer, neurological disorders, and cardiovascular diseases. This will allow for interventions at earlier, more treatable stages, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.</p>
