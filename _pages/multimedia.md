## AI for Medical Imaging
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have proposed a novel score-matching formula to derive a new score function through deep learning on an image dataset. By integrating our new score function into the image reconstruction process, we have developed a new iterative reconstruction method within the MAP estimation framework to enhance image quality. We have evaluated the performance of our image reconstruction method on both public medical CT datasets and clinical raw datasets. Our reconstruction method consistently produced higher quality images in terms of PSNR and SSIM metrics across diverse datasets. Notably, on Siemens and GE clinical CT raw datasets, our proposed approach achieved superior denoising and deblurring effects over the competing methods, illustrating remarkable generalizability and stability. Our proposed score matching formula holds potential in image denoising, deblurring, and generation.</p>

## Future Directions in AI for Medical Imaging
<b>Self-Supervised and Transfer Learning</b>: Enhances AI capabilities with less labeled data.
<br>

<b>Federated Learning</b>: Protects patient privacy while enabling collaborative model training.
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Real-Time Imaging</b>: AI-assisted tools for intraoperative guidance and real-time diagnostics.Uses imaging biomarkers to predict treatment response and optimize therapies.</p>
