## AI for Medical Imaging
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have proposed a novel score-matching formula to derive a new score function through deep learning on an image dataset. By integrating our new score function into the image reconstruction process, we have developed a new iterative reconstruction method within the MAP estimation framework to enhance image quality. We have evaluated the performance of our image reconstruction method on both public medical CT datasets and clinical raw datasets. Our reconstruction method consistently produced higher quality images in terms of PSNR and SSIM metrics across diverse datasets. Notably, on Siemens and GE clinical CT raw datasets, our proposed approach achieved superior denoising and deblurring effects over the competing methods, illustrating remarkable generalizability and stability. Our proposed score matching formula holds potential in image denoising, deblurring, and generation.</p>

## Future Directions in AI for Medical Imaging
<p style="text-align: justify;">The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into medical imaging is progressing rapidly, paving the way for transformative advancements in healthcare. In the coming years, AI is expected to revolutionize diagnostic accuracy, treatment planning, and clinical workflows. By identifying subtle patterns in medical images that might be overlooked by the human eye, AI will enhance diagnostic precision. Future AI models will improve in sensitivity and specificity, enabling earlier detection of conditions such as cancer, neurological disorders, and cardiovascular diseases. This will allow for interventions at earlier, more treatable stages, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.</p>
