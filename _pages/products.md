## Product Development

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    <b>Medical Image Reconstruction:</b> We are developing AI-driven image reconstruction and processing software designed to maximize diagnostic clarity. By utilizing advanced deep learning algorithms, these tools significantly enhance image quality and processing efficiency, improving the accuracy of cancer detection and clinical diagnosis.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    <b>Breast Photoacoustic Tomographic Imaging System:</b> Our Breast Photoacoustic Tomography (PAT) system combines optical contrast with ultrasonic resolution to generate detailed, three-dimensional images of breast tissue. By targeting the strong optical absorption of hemoglobin, this technology effectively visualizes the tumor-associated vasculature (angiogenesis) often missing in standard scans, making it a powerful tool for detecting early-stage breast cancer.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    <b>Carotid Artery Plaque Photoacoustic Imaging System:</b> This emerging imaging platform leverages the dual benefits of optics and ultrasound to assess stroke risk with high precision. By utilizing laser-induced ultrasound waves, the system visualizes the specific composition, structure, and biological properties of carotid artery plaques—critical factors in determining plaque stability and preventing cardiovascular events.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    <b>Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Monitor:</b> By combining optical imaging with machine learning, we are advancing the field of non-invasive blood glucose monitoring. Our method utilizes a proprietary predictive model that maps acquired optical data to reference blood glucose levels, achieving the accuracy and stability required for regulatory approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
