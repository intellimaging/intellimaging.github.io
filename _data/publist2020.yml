- title: "Machine Learning for Tomographic Imaging"
  image: MLTI_IOP.jpg
  description: We present a unified overview of deep-learning-based tomographic imaging. Key concepts, including classic reconstruction ideas and human vision inspired insights, are introduced as a foundation for a thorough examination of artificial neural networks and deep tomographic reconstruction. X-ray CT and MRI reconstruction methods are covered in detail, and other medical imaging applications are discussed as well.

- title: "Image Reconstruction is a New Frontier of Machine Learning"
  image: TMI_MLIC.jpg
  description: This is the first special issue dedicated to the theme of "Machine Learning for Image Reconstruction". In addition to well-known analytic and iterative methods for tomographic image reconstruction, machine learning is an emerging approach for image reconstruction, and likewise image reconstruction is a new frontier of machine learning. There are exciting research and application opportunities ahead for smart imaging and precision medicine.
